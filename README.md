d2etal-rushee
=============

Setup the char_configs the way you would normally and run! 
Visit http://www.projectetal.com/forums/index.php?forum/#project-d2etal.3 for more info.

A few things to mention:

-When using the rushbot
if you are going to skip ahead or back up a script YOU MUST PAUSE FIRST with printscreen.

-If for some reason the rushbot leaves the game the rushee will also leave!
- It's somewhere in there but I'll have to disable the leader check.

-When the rushee is called to enter Duriel's tomb and place staff in the orifice, 
be patient it may take 1 second, it may take 10 seconds depending on which tomb it is. 
I'm not sure if there is a better way of doing this at this time, although I do have something to try.

-In the NTBot char_config: I recommend you setting your rushee's NTConfig_PartyMaxTime = 20; to 2000 
this ensures the rushee won't leave before your rushbot gets in game.

-I plan on adding in skills/tomb/anya quests in the near future.
