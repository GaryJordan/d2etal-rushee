d2etal-rushee
=============

Setup the char_configs the way you would normally and run! 
Visit http://www.projectetal.com/forums/index.php?forum/#project-d2etal.3 for more info.

A few things to mention:

-The Rushees MUST have a TownPortal Scroll in their inventory for Den of Evil!

-The Rushees Inventory MUST have the first 3 left rows free for use in act 2!

When using the rushbot:
-If you are going to skip ahead or back up a script YOU MUST PAUSE FIRST with pause/break.

-If for some reason the rushbot leaves the game the rushee will also leave!

-Currently you either need a bumper to join or bring your own in with the game to advance to the next difficulty. -- or crush and comment out a5 script.
